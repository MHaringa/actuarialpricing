## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version:

* `summary.reduce()` now gives correct aggregation for periods "months" and "quarters" 
* `rows_per_date()` is added to determine active portfolio for a certain date

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.5
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of insurancerating.
All packages that I could install passed.
